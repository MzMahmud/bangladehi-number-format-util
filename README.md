# Bangladehi Number Format Util
This is a project to convert any Bangla or English number string into Bangladeshi number format which is the [Crore-Lakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_numerals) system. 

This project gives two APIs.

1. given a `number string`, `getFormattedNumber` would return another string that is thousand and hudred seperated by `comma`.

1. given a `number string`, `convertToWord` returns another string which is the number in word.

## Installation
As until now, this project is implemented in `Java` and `Javaspript`. Both the implementation is done with raw language, that is not any external library is needed.
